        Hello! I'm December Rain Gomez, I usually only go by "Rain".  I am a 1st year Computer Science student who not only hopes to excel in the technical fields but also the creative ones. I am not just what people call an "achiever" in terms of academics, but I am also an artist; I dwell in music and arts. But I still aspire to be great in my field to get a job in the future in my industry.
        <br><br>I am proficient in web design languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (along with frameworks like ReactJS). I also dabble a bit on C languages, Java, and Python. I currently have almost 3 years of experience in programming and web design, starting from when I took TVL-ICT in Senior High School in the University of the Cordilleras from 2022-2024, and now Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in the University of Baguio.
