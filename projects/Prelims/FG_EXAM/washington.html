    <p><a href="https://choosewashingtonstate.com/why-washington/our-key-sectors/tourism/">Washington’s</a> awe-inspiring beauty and diverse geography and culture are natural draws for tourists around the world. Throughout the year, residents and visitors alike travel to towns large and small to see stunning vistas carved by volcanoes and mighty glaciers, steal some calm on a deserted ocean beach, catch some waves along the coast or carve some turns in pristine powder as night falls.</p>
    <p>Indeed, Washington is an outdoor recreation and sports paradise, from boating and camping to treks through one of the few temperate rain forests in the world. For those that like their adventures to be a little more citified, visitors can enjoy world-class restaurants featuring the freshest seafood the Salish Sea has to offer. If these arts are more your style, roam through endless museums, enjoy a symphony concert in the park, catch a touring Broadway production or bask in the skill of a street musician who can play guitar and hula hoop at the same time.</p>
    <p>Feeling like venturing out? Enjoy a day in Edmond’s Creative District before watching the sunset over the Olympics, or spend a weekend in Leavenworth; a Bavarian-themed town tucked away in the lee of the Cascade Mountain range. Tour Washington wine country with its hundreds of wineries and sprawling vineyards. Indulge in a facial or spa treatment in a historic hotel to renew and recharge, such as the Davenport in Spokane or luxurious Fairmont in downtown Seattle.</p>
    <p>Whatever strikes your fancy, Washington is ready to exceed your expectations.</p>
    <h3><i>Some things never change.</i></h3>
    <p>Bing Crosby takes you on a journey of Washington State circa 1968, showing you many of the wonders that continue to draw tens of thousands of visitors to the state each year. For locals, it’s fun to spot a few icons that have become cherished memories of our past, like the Seattle skyline before skyscrapers.</p>
